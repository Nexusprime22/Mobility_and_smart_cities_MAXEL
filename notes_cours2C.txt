transitive closure : to build it, I need ..., so that I can determine (i,k)
e.g if start (a,b), there exist (b,a)
if (a,b) and (b,c) and (a,c) then time_ab + time_bc = time_ac
iterative operations on graph to find the nearest path

istransitive may need to be modified for exam

not reflexive = no diagonal
so irreflexive

symetrical = if (a,b) in (x,y) then (b,a) in (y,x)

transitive = if (x,y) and (y,z) then (x,z)

if one condition does not satisfy, then no "relationType"

------
to constitute this mobility graph
i have to represent matrix using geographic data

matrix -> 
symetrical (value (x,y) same as (y,x))
reflexive (0 on diagonal)
transitive (x,y) + (y,z) -> (x,z)

An order in the broad sense (i.e. less strict)
– Reminder: It is reflexive,
anti-symmetrical and
transitive
– Let N * and the relation y |
x (x divides exactly y,
without remainder / or
again y modulo x == 0).
• Show that the relation is
an order in the broad
sense
• Let X be a subset of N *
such that X = {1, 2, 3, 5,
10, 20, 30}
Calculate the table
representing x | y on X

on fait un automate qui relie toutes les valeurs de l'ensemble (même (a,a)) en fonction de la grille
(sagital diagram)
ça aidera
on remplit la grille
(diagonale -> (a,a) (b,b) (c,c) etc.)
first row -> (a,a), (a,b), etc.
(a the smallest value)
(z the highest, on the extremity)

anti symmetry because
transitive

(1,3) to (5,5) we need (1,5) (in scheme)

prehover -> not all elts are comparable (no possible ranking)

from grid we have 7 notes, 22 transitions in example shown
