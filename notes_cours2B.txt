dynamic prgrming (we share part of rsrcs, parts of solutions of S)
we just have to manipulate 1 array consuming few bytes
if this solution is OK, we store it
we don't store all the elements in memory
dynamic prgming allows to reduce mem consumption

in marketing, the most used is the star algo
but we will present recursive algo

-----

we need to prove the feasibility and so the initial validity (of the project we are involved in)

----

either relation is reflexive or not
anti symetric is : for each x and y, (y,x) not in R if (x,y) in R, except for x==y

----

transitive relation (very important to compute the cheapest itinerary)
(djiktstra)

from a diagram without transitivity
i can build the matrix origin faster
