If I associate a position in 2D space (resp. 3D) with each node (1, 2, 3, etc.) and each relation results in a directed segment connecting 2 nodes

i) does there exist the possibility of arranging nodes and edges without any edge  cutting?

In a 2D or 3D space where nodes are represented as points and relations are represented as directed segments, it's possible to arrange nodes and edges in a way that avoids edge cutting, assuming the segments do not overlap. This essentially means that you can position the nodes in such a way that no two directed segments cross each other. The feasibility of such an arrangement depends on the specific relations and their geometric properties.

ii) can you calculate the best arrangement of the
nodes of the relation so that the number of
intersecting edges is minimized?

To calculate the best arrangement of nodes to minimize the number of intersecting edges, you are essentially trying to solve a geometric optimization problem. This problem is often referred to as a "graph drawing" or "graph layout" problem, and it's a well-studied area in computer science and mathematics.

There are various algorithms and techniques available to address this issue, such as:

Force-directed layout: This is a common method where nodes are treated as charged particles, and forces are applied to edges to minimize their lengths and intersections.

Orthogonal layout: In this approach, edges are drawn using horizontal and vertical segments to minimize intersections.

Layered drawing: Particularly useful for directed acyclic graphs, this method arranges nodes in layers with edges mainly flowing downward to minimize intersections.

Sugiyama framework: This is a method for hierarchically structured graphs, which arranges nodes in layers and minimizes the number of edge crossings.
